Birth Rate
Birth statistics are gathered from both public and restricted-use microdata at the National Center for Health Statistics. Birth rates for all women aged 15-44, as well as for women aged 15-44 by age, Hispanic origin, marital status, and state (shown in Figures 1), are derived from Vital Statistics Final Births reports for 2015, 2019, and the 2020 Provisional Birth Report. Birth rates by mother's education level, nativity, birth order, and cohort are derived using public birth microdata from the NBER Natality Database for the years 1980-1989 and NCHS microdata for the years 1990-2019.
Population Data
The research utilizes single-age population numbers from the CDC SEER database for all races from 1969 to 2019 and for race and Hispanic origin from 1990 to 2019. (CDC NCI 2021). The data is publicly accessible at https://seer.cancer.gov/popdata/download.html 
We use population shares from the Current Population Survey's Annual Social and Economic Supplement to estimate the population by other groupings. This information is derived from IPUMS. IPUMS-CPS does not presently support the storage or referencing of custom extracts, although it does support redistribution for replication purposes. In the folders data educ and datahisp, the archive includes the extracted data and codebook. The complete URL is included in the data reference in the main article.
The graphs 6 and 8 illustrate the relationship between longer-term changes in birth rates and state-level social and economic dynamics. The following sites provide data on these trends.
Female-Male Median Wage Ratio
Female-male median wage ratios at the state level are derived using data from the 2004-2008 and 2015-2019 American Community Surveys. We take the ratio of the state's median pay and salary income for all full-time, full-year women and men. FTFY employees are those who reported working an average of at least 35 hours per week for 40 weeks in the preceding year. All salaries are in current currency. This data is derived from the American Community Surveys conducted between 2007 and 2018.
Child Care Expenses
The change in child care expenditures among states is estimated using self-reported child care expenditures from the Current Population Survey's Annual Social and Economic Supplement. Child care expenditures were gathered beginning in 2010 as part of the Supplemental Poverty Measure Module. We compute average reported child care costs at the state level using the 2010 CPS ASEC in the earlier years and the 2016-2020 CPS ASEC in the later periods. The CPI-U is used to convert expenditures to 2019 real dollars. We limit our estimations to households with children under the age of 12 and those with positive child care costs.

Demographic variables
Demographic variables used as controls include the percentage of married people in each state, the percentage of White, non-Hispanic people, and the percentage of Hispanic people; the percentage of people with less than a high school diploma, the percentage with a high school diploma, and the percentage with some college education. These data come from the 2001-2019 CPS Merged Outgoing Rotation Group Sample. The Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics collaborate to develop the CPS. The data is taken from the National Bureau of Economic Research. The data for the CPS MORG is obtained through https://www.nber.org/research/da
